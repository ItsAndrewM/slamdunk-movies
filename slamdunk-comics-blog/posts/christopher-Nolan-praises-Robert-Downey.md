# Christopher Nolan praises Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man

Christopher Nolan is one of the most acclaimed and influential filmmakers of our time. He is known for his complex and original stories, his stunning visuals, and his mastery of the cinematic medium. He has directed some of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of the past two decades, such as The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet.

Nolan is also a fan of Robert Downey Jr., the actor who played Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Downey Jr. is widely regarded as the face of the MCU, the most successful film franchise in history. He starred in 10 films as Tony Stark/Iron Man, from 2008's Iron Man to 2019's Avengers: Endgame. His charismatic and nuanced performance as the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist superhero won over millions of fans around the world.

In a recent interview with Josh Horowitz on his Happy Sad Confused podcast, Nolan expressed his admiration for Downey Jr.'s work as Iron Man. He said:

> When [Jon] Favreau had the insight to cast him as Iron Man, I mean that’s … one of the greatest casting decisions in the history of movies. You look at what that did and where that went with everything. I think that was Jon just knowing what an incredible actor, what an incredible potential that was from Downey.

Nolan is not alone in his praise for Downey Jr.'s casting as Iron Man. Many critics and fans have also recognized the importance and impact of his role in launching and sustaining the MCU. Downey Jr. brought a unique blend of humor, charm, vulnerability, and depth to his character, making him relatable and likable despite his flaws. He also had great chemistry with his co-stars, especially Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), and Tom Holland (Spider-Man).

Downey Jr.'s casting as Iron Man was also a remarkable comeback story for the actor, who had struggled with substance abuse and legal troubles in the past. He had been considered a risky choice by Marvel Studios, who initially offered him a low salary and a contract that depended on his behavior. However, Downey Jr. proved himself to be a reliable and dedicated actor, who worked hard to embody his character and improve his craft. He also became one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, earning more than $75 million for Avengers: Endgame alone.

However, Downey Jr. has also expressed some doubts and regrets about playing Iron Man for so long. In an interview with The New York Times published earlier this month, he said:

> You start to wonder if a muscle you have hasn’t atrophied.

He was referring to his acting skills outside of the superhero genre, which he felt he had neglected or compromised by being associated with one iconic role for over a decade. He also said he was ready to move on from Iron Man after Avengers: Endgame, which marked the end of his character's arc in the MCU.

Downey Jr.'s next film is Oppenheimer, directed by Nolan himself. The film is a biographical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Downey Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a businessman and politician who was involved in the Manhattan Project and later became the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.

Oppenheimer is Nolan's first film since he left Warner Bros., his longtime studio partner, after a dispute over their decision to release their films simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters during the pandemic. Nolan signed a deal with Universal Pictures to make Oppenheimer, which he wrote himself and will produce with his wife Emma Thomas.

Oppenheimer will reunite Nolan with some of his frequent collaborators, such as Cillian Murphy (who plays Oppenheimer), Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, John David Washington, Michael Caine, and Hans Zimmer (who will compose the score).

Oppenheimer is expected to be released on July 21st, 2023. It will be interesting to see how Nolan and Downey Jr. work together on this film, which is a departure from their usual genres and styles. Will they create another cinematic masterpiece? Will they challenge and inspire each other? Will they make history?

We can only wait and see.
