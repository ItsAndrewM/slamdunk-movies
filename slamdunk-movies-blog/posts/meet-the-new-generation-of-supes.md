# Meet the New Generation of Supes in Gen V: the Action-Packed Spinoff of The Boys

The Boys, the hit Amazon Prime Video series that takes a dark and twisted look at the world of superheroes, is getting a spinoff. Gen V, which will premiere on September 29, 2023, is a subversive and raunchy comedy that follows a group of young and diverse Supes as they attend a prestigious superhero college run by Vought International. The show promises to be a wild and irreverent ride that explores the lives of hormonal, competitive, and morally ambiguous Supes who are eager to prove themselves and land the best contracts in the best cities.

Amazon Prime Video has released the first teaser trailer for Gen V, which gives us a glimpse of the characters, the setting, and the tone of the show. The trailer opens with a voice-over from Patrick Schwarzenegger, who plays Jason/Golden Boy, a popular and charismatic fire manipulator who is the top-ranked student at the school. He introduces us to some of his classmates, such as Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair), a blood bender with a tragic past; Andre Anderson (Chance Perdomo), a metal bender who is Jason's best friend and rival; Emma Shaw (Lizze Broadway), a half-inch sized Supe who can grow to regular size; Cate Dunlap (Maddie Phillips), a mind empath who can sense other people's emotions; Jordan (Derek Luh and London Thor), a gender-shifter who can change their appearance at will; Sam Riordan (Asa Germann), a young Supe who is new to the school; and Barbie Lipa (Dua Lipa), a pop star doll who is also a Supe.

The trailer then shows us some of the action-packed and hilarious scenes from the show, such as Jason setting fire to a rival team's flag during a game of capture the flag; Marie using her blood bending powers to make someone vomit blood; Andre manipulating metal objects to create weapons and shields; Emma growing to full size and kicking someone in the face; Cate reading someone's mind and finding out their dirty secrets; Jordan changing their gender and appearance to seduce different people; Sam discovering his hidden powers and causing chaos; and Barbie Lipa performing her hit song "Levitating" on stage.

The trailer also reveals some of the other characters and plot points of the show, such as Shelley Conn as the headmistress of the school, who has a mysterious agenda; Sean Patrick Thomas as Polarity, a Supe who can manipulate magnetic fields and who is Jason's mentor; Marco Pigossi as Doctor Edison Cardosa, a scientist who works for Vought and who conducts experiments on the students; Jason Ritter as an unnamed character who seems to be an antagonist; Alexander Calvert as an unnamed character who seems to be Sam's love interest; Clancy Brown as Richard "Rich Brink" Brinkerhoff, a former Supe who is now an alcoholic and homeless; Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, Colby Minifie as Ashley Barrett, Claudia Doumit as Victoria Neuman, P.J. Byrne as Adam Bourke, Jensen Ackles as Soldier Boy, John Cena as Ken Cena, Will Ferrell as Skipper Roberts , and more.

The trailer ends with Jason saying "Welcome to Gen V. The future of superheroes starts here." The show's logo then appears on screen, followed by the release date.
