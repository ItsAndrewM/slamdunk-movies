# Warner Bros is looking at delaying Dune 2 until 2024 because of the writers strike

Dune 2, the highly anticipated sequel to Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi epic Dune, may face a significant delay in its release date due to the ongoing strikes by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). According to Variety, Warner Bros. Film Group is considering pushing back the release of Dune 2 from November 3, 2023 to sometime in 2024 if the strikes continue.

The strikes, which began on October 18, 2023, are affecting the production and promotion of many Hollywood projects. The WGA is striking over issues such as streaming residuals, diversity and inclusion, and health care. The SAG-AFTRA is striking over issues such as interactive media contracts, performance capture, and health and safety. The strikes have disrupted the work of thousands of writers and actors, as well as other crew members and industry professionals.

One of the consequences of the strikes is that actors are not allowed to perform publicity duties for their upcoming films. This poses a problem for Warner Bros., which would have expected to benefit from media appearances by the star-studded cast of Dune 2, which includes Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård, Léa Seydoux, Christopher Walken, and more. Without the actors' involvement in promoting the film, Warner Bros. may lose some of the hype and buzz that Dune 2 needs to succeed at the box office.

Dune 2 is a sequel to Dune, which was released in October 2021 after being delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dune was based on the first half of Frank Herbert's classic novel of the same name, which tells the story of Paul Atreides (Chalamet), a young man who becomes a messianic figure in a galactic struggle over a precious substance called spice. Dune received critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing over $400 million worldwide and earning six Academy Award nominations.

Dune 2 will adapt the second half of Herbert's novel, which follows Paul's rise to power and his confrontation with his enemies. Villeneuve has described Dune 2 as "a very different movie" from Dune, with more action and more emotion. He has also said that Dune 2 will be "the most fulfilling experience so far" for him as a filmmaker.

However, fans of Dune may have to wait longer than expected to see Villeneuve's vision come to life on the big screen. Warner Bros. has not officially announced any change in the release date of Dune 2 yet, but sources say that the studio is in discussions with Legendary Entertainment, its co-producer on the film, about a possible delay. Legendary Entertainment has not commented on the matter either.

If Warner Bros. decides to delay Dune 2 to 2024, it will join other films that are reportedly considering similar moves due to the strikes, such as Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and The Color Purple. However, some films that are already completed or close to completion may stick to their original release dates, such as Barbie, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and Oppenheimer.

The strikes are still ongoing as of this writing, with no clear resolution in sight. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA are negotiating with their respective employers' associations, but no major breakthroughs have been reported so far. The strikes have been described as historic and unprecedented in their scale and impact on Hollywood.
