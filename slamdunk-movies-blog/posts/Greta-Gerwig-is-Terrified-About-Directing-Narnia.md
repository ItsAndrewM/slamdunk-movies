# Greta Gerwig is "Terrified" About Directing Narnia Movies for Netflix After Barbie

Greta Gerwig, the director of Barbie, the live-action fantasy comedy film based on the popular Mattel fashion dolls, has admitted that she is "terrified" about directing two movies based on The Chronicles of Narnia books by C.S. Lewis for Netflix. The filmmaker, who is also known for her acclaimed films Lady Bird and Little Women, said that she hasn't even started to wrap her arms around the project, but that she feels that being scared is a good place to start.

Gerwig made these comments in an interview with Total Film magazine, where she discussed her latest film Barbie, which stars Margot Robbie as the titular character, and Ryan Gosling as her partner Ken. The film, which was co-written by Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach, has been a huge hit at the box office, grossing over $70 million in its opening weekend.

However, when asked about her next challenge of adapting the beloved fantasy series Narnia for Netflix, Gerwig did not hide her anxiety and excitement.

"I haven't even really started wrapping my arms around it, but I'm properly scared of it, which feels like a good place to start," Gerwig said. "I think when I'm scared, it's always a good sign. Maybe when I stop being scared, it'll be like, 'Maybe I shouldn't do that one.'"

Gerwig added that she hopes to make "all different kinds of movies" in her career, and that she is drawn to "older story forms" that have a timeless quality and appeal.

"I think I always go back to those older story forms because I went to Catholic school and I resonate with them," she said. "And I think there's something about Narnia that has that quality of being ancient and new at the same time."

Gerwig's involvement in the Narnia project was first reported by The New Yorker in a profile of Gerwig and Mattel in July. According to the magazine, Gerwig has a deal to direct two films in the Narnia franchise for Netflix, which acquired the film and TV rights to the books in 2018.

The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven books that tell the story of children who enter a magical world called Narnia through a wardrobe, where they encounter talking animals, mythical creatures, and an evil witch. The books have sold over 100 million copies worldwide and have been adapted into various media, including a BBC TV series in the 1980s and a film trilogy by Disney and Fox in the 2000s.

Gerwig is not the only filmmaker who has expressed interest in directing a Narnia film. Christopher Nolan, the director of Oppenheimer, Inception, and The Dark Knight trilogy, has also revealed that he would love to direct a James Bond movie someday, but only under the right circumstances. The filmmaker, who is a longtime fan of the iconic spy franchise, said that directing a 007 film would be "an amazing privilege", but also a "particular set of constraints" that he would have to fully commit to.

Nolan made these comments in an interview with Josh Horowitz on the Happy Sad Confused podcast , where he discussed his latest film Oppenheimer , which chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer , the American physicist who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II . Nolan said that he was fascinated by Oppenheimer's story and his moral dilemmas , and that he wanted to explore the themes of science , history , and human nature in his film .

However , when asked about his potential involvement in the James Bond franchise , Nolan did not hide his enthusiasm and admiration for the series , which he said has influenced his own filmography in many ways .

"It would be an amazing privilege to do one," Nolan said. "At the same time , when you take on a character or work like that , you're working within a particular set of constraints . It's the kind of responsibility I felt very much taking on Batman ."

Nolan added that he would only want to direct a Bond film if he could bring his own creative vision and input to the table , including casting , writing , and everything else .

"You wouldn't want to take on a film not fully committed to what you could bring to the table creatively ," he said. "So as a writer , casting , everything - it's a full package . You'd have to be really needed and wanted in terms of bringing the totality of what you bring to a character ."

Nolan has previously expressed his interest in directing a Bond film in several occasions , and has even met with the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson in the past . He has also incorporated elements of the Bond style and aesthetic in some of his films , such as The Dark Knight Rises , Inception , and Tenet .

However , Nolan has also stated that he would only want to direct a Bond film if he could start from scratch , meaning cast his own Bond and write his own script . This could be a possibility now that Daniel Craig's tenure as 007 is over , and the franchise is looking for a new direction and star .

Nolan is known for working with some of the same actors across his different projects , such as Cillian Murphy , Christian Bale , Tom Hardy , Michael Caine , and Robert Pattinson . Some of these actors have been rumored or suggested as potential candidates for the next Bond role , which could give Nolan an advantage if he were to direct a Bond film .

However , Nolan has also said that he is not actively pursuing or campaigning for the job , and that he is happy to enjoy the Bond films as a fan and an admirer .

"I love those movies ," Nolan said. "The influence of those movies on my filmography is embarrassingly apparent ."
